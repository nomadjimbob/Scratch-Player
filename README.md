# Scratch-Player
A simple web based Scratch 3.0 player

## Background
This project was created as I needed a way to display a list of saved Scratch projects, on a loop, that changed every few minutes, with webcam support.

## Code
Most of this code uses the build libraries from the [Scratch team](https://github.com/LLK) and some work from [tianbaoliu's Scratch Player](https://github.com/tianbaoliu/scratch_player).
